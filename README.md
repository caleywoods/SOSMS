SOSMS is a [twilio](http://www.twilio.com/)/[sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) powered web app that allows people to connect with family during emergencies.

### How does this work? ###

Well, pretty simple really. Let's say there's a tornado that wipes out
your town, Fooville. Your parents who live 8 hours away in Barbaz see on
the news that Fooville has been devasted by a tornado and are instantly
worried about you.

You, being the smart, tech saavy person you are just so happened to
visit the SOSMS website a few months back and created an account with
us. After creating said account, you added both your parents and your
brother as contacts to be notified via voice/sms in the event you text
our app. So...

From your aid station in Fooville you text "SAFE" to the SOSMS phone
number and your contacts are all immediately notified via SMS or a phone call
that you've checked in.
