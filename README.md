SOSMS
=====

##SOSMS is a [twilio](http://www.twilio.com/)/[sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) powered web app that allows people to connect with family during emergencies.##

## How does this work? ##

Well, pretty simple really. Let's say there's a tornado that wipes out
your town, Fooville. Your parents who live 8 hours away in Barbaz see on
the news that Fooville has been devasted by a tornado and are instantly
worried about you.

Your parents, scared to death, hear about SOSMS and log onto the site.
On the site, they enter your phone number and their phone number or
email address.

From your aid station in Fooville you text "SAFE" to the SOSMS phone
number and your parents are immediately notified via SMS or email that a
phone number matching the one they're searching for has checked in.
